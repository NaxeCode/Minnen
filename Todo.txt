Since changing the Design, the game needs some extra features and implementations so, I need to come up with a new todo list that describes the features we currently need to undergo the next milestone which is 0.1.0

Here's what needs to be done for 0.1.0 to be done and merged into the main branch:
[ ] Remove everything not related to the main game's code
[ ] plan out the initial archetecture based on current design creteria
[ ] Start implementing classes, functions, and setting up MVP prototype.
