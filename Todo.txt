Since changing the Design, the game needs some extra features and implementations so, I need to come up with a new todo list that describes the features we currently need to undergo the next milestone which is 0.1.0

Here's what needs to be done for 0.1.0 to be done and merged into the main branch:
[ ] basic art
[ ] basic sfx
[ ] basic music
[ ] Level needs some sort of requirement to pass

current todo list:
[ ] Implement TiledEditor
[ ] Make the movement feel better
[ ] Implement *interaction* button
