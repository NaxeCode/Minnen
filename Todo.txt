Since changing the Design, the game needs some extra features and implementations so, I need to come up with a new todo list that describes the features we currently need to undergo the next milestone which is 0.1.0
We'll split the Todo lists into a couple of catagories; first being core gameplay stuff, meaning the general game mechanics across all levels in the game

core gameplay Todo list:
[ ] Implement TiledEditor
[ ] Make the movement feel better
[ ] Implement *interaction* button
